# Planning-Poker-for-Personal-Project

## Team Members:

* **Moderator:** Rohit
* **Estimators:** Yamini, Arun

## Description:

The Planning Poker Assignment involves using the Planning Poker technique to estimate the effort, complexity, and uncertainty associated with various project tasks. This collaborative exercise ensures that team members have a shared understanding of the tasks and can make informed decisions regarding project planning and resource allocation.

## Process:

### Moderator's Role:

Rohit, the moderator, facilitates the Planning Poker session, ensuring that all estimators participate actively and that the discussion remains focused on the task at hand.

### Estimators' Role:

Yamini and Arun, the estimators, assess each task based on their understanding and expertise. They assign values that reflect the effort, complexity, and uncertainty involved.

## Relative Sizing:

* The team uses a predefined scale (A, 3, 5, 8, and K) to assign values to each task.
* **A:** Very Low Effort, Complexity, and Uncertainty
* **3:** Low Effort, Complexity, and Uncertainty
* **5:** Medium Effort, Complexity, and Uncertainty
* **8:** High Effort, Complexity, and Uncertainty
* **K:** Very High Effort, Complexity, and Uncertainty

## Task Evaluation:

* Each task is evaluated independently by the estimators. They consider the following factors:
* **Effort:** The amount of work required to complete the task.
* **Complexity:** The level of difficulty involved in executing the task.
* **Uncertainty:** The degree of unpredictability or unknowns associated with the task.

## Consensus Building:

After the initial estimates are made, the estimators discuss their ratings to reach a consensus. The discussion helps clarify any discrepancies and ensures that everyone has a common understanding of the task requirements.

## Final Estimates:

Once a consensus is reached, the final estimates are recorded. These estimates guide the planning and scheduling of tasks, helping the team allocate resources effectively and set realistic timelines.

## Example Estimates:

* **Task A:** Very Low Effort, Complexity, and Uncertainty (Rated as A)
* **Task K:** Very High Effort, Complexity, and Uncertainty (Rated as K)

## Benefits:

* **Improved Accuracy:** By leveraging the collective knowledge and expertise of the team, Planning Poker helps produce more accurate and reliable estimates.
* **Enhanced Communication:** The discussion and consensus-building process foster better communication and understanding among team members.
* **Informed Decision-Making:** The detailed evaluation of tasks enables more informed decisions regarding project planning and resource allocation.

This detailed Planning Poker exercise ensures that project tasks are accurately estimated, leading to efficient project management and successful completion.
